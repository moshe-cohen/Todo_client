## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm
- Postgres

To set up and run this application locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [URL to your repository]`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your Postgres database. You will need to create a new database and adjust the connection parameters in the application's configuration file (`[specify the exact file and location here]`). If you're new to Postgres, you can follow [this guide](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-start.html) for help.
4. Run the database migration: `[insert command here, if applicable]`
5. Start the application: `npm start`

Please note that the application expects a running Postgres instance. If you encounter any issues with setting up Postgres, please refer to the official [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).
